# Introduction

Welcome to **ArmaRAMDb**, a high-performance in-memory database designed specifically for Arma 3 mission and mod developers.

## What is ArmaRAMDb?

ArmaRAMDb is a powerful persistence solution for Arma 3 that provides:

- **In-Memory Performance**: Lightning-fast data operations powered by C# .NET 8
- **Redis-Like API**: Familiar, easy-to-use commands for data manipulation
- **Automatic Persistence**: GZip-compressed saves with configurable backups
- **Thread-Safe**: Built for multiplayer environments with concurrent data structures
- **Context-Aware**: Seamless Steam ID integration for player-specific data

## Why ArmaRAMDb?

Traditional Arma 3 persistence solutions often suffer from:

- Slow file I/O operations blocking gameplay
- Complex setup and configuration
- Limited data structure support
- Poor multiplayer synchronization

ArmaRAMDb solves these problems by keeping all data in memory for instant access, while automatically persisting to disk in the background. This means:

::callout{icon="i-lucide-zap" color="primary"}
**Zero gameplay impact** - All database operations complete in microseconds
::

::callout{icon="i-lucide-package" color="secondary"}
**Simple to use** - Familiar Redis-style commands that mission makers already know
::

::callout{icon="i-lucide-shield" color="neutral"}
**Safe and reliable** - Automatic backups ensure your data is never lost
::

## Use Cases

ArmaRAMDb is perfect for:

- **Player Progression**: Save player stats, skills, and experience
- **Persistent Bases**: Store building placements and base state
- **Inventory Systems**: Manage player gear and loadouts
- **Mission State**: Save and restore mission progress
- **Leaderboards**: Track player scores and achievements
- **Vehicle Persistence**: Save vehicle locations and modifications
- **Economy Systems**: Manage player money and trading

## Architecture

ArmaRAMDb consists of two components:

1. **C# Extension** (`.dll`/`.so`): Native library handling all database operations
2. **SQF Functions**: Arma 3 script functions for easy integration

The extension uses three concurrent data stores:

- **Key-Value Store**: Simple key-value pairs
- **Hash Store**: Nested key-field-value structures (like Redis hashes)
- **List Store**: Ordered lists with positional operations

## Performance

ArmaRAMDb is designed for speed:

- All operations execute in **microseconds**
- Thread-safe concurrent data structures
- Minimal memory footprint
- Automatic chunking for large data (>20KB)
- Background persistence doesn't block gameplay
