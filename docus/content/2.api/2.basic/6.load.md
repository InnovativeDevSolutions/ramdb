# ramdb_db_fnc_load

## Description
Loads the database from disk storage. This function restores all data (key-value pairs, hash tables, and lists) from the previously saved database file.

## Syntax
```sqf
[] call ramdb_db_fnc_load
```

## Parameters
None. This function does not require any parameters.

## Return Value
None. The operation runs synchronously and loads the database immediately.

## Examples
### Load the database on the server:
```sqf
[] call ramdb_db_fnc_load;
```

### Call the load function remotely from a client:
```sqf
[] remoteExecCall ["ramdb_db_fnc_load", 2, false];
```

## Notes
- This function should typically be called during server initialization
- Any existing data in memory will be overwritten with the data from disk
- If no database file exists, nothing will happen
- Loading does not affect ongoing operations, but might replace values in memory
- For safety, it's recommended to call this function only when necessary
